    "Welcome to the third day of our hands-on course!\n",
    "Today, you will focus on understanding how a knowledge base supports robotic decision-making. You’ll learn to query the knowledge base to identify necessary actions for tasks, like how to perceive the milk inside the fridge.\n",

    "By the end of the session, you will have successfully made queries to the knowledge base, enabling the robot to determine the steps required to complete its tasks.\n"
